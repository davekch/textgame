Welcome to textgame's documentation!
====================================

textgame is a package for python3 that makes it easy to write text based adventure games.

.. code-block::

   → look
   You are standing in the middle of a wide open field. In the west the silhouette of an
   enormous castle cuts the sky. North of you is a birch grove. A dark forest reaches to
   the east.

   → go south
   You are in a wide rocky pit. An aisle leads upwards to the north.
   There's a sack of coins here!

   → take coins
   You carry now a sack of coins.

   → inventory
   You are now carrying:
    A sack of coins

   → eat coins
   I don't want to eat that.
