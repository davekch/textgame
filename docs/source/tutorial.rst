Tutorial
================

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of building a text adventure game with textgame.

Our game will have

- a few rooms to discover
- some items that can be picked up
- a NPC to do some conversation / trading with
- deadly traps
- timed events

Before you start, make sure that you have textgame installed. If not, please :doc:`do so now <intro>`. I recommend using a virtual environment.

Ready? Go!
