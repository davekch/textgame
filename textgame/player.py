textgame.player
=====================

This module contains a class :class:`textgame.player.Player` that is used to define
what a player is able to do in the game. Every of its methods that get called by
:class:`textgame.parser.Parser` must take a noun (string) as an argument and return
either a string that describes the action or a :class:`textgame.parser.EnterYesNoLoop`.
For convenience, this module provides wrappers for Player methods:

- :func:`textgame.player.player_method`
- :func:`textgame.player.action_method`
